*I must not burnout. Burnout is the mind-killer. Burnout is the little death that brings total
obliteration.*

-- *Not Dune*

### Step 1, start experimenting 2 years ago

I failed a [my first game jam](https://inthewall.itch.io/stroll-jam-entry) in February 2021,
where I (unrelated to said failure) forced our designers to write a dialogue format in `JSON`.
They took to it alright, but had to run it under my code and go through it to discover if they
had forgotten a field. I was under too much of a crunch at the time and there wasn't enough
dialogue to justify writing (or setting up) a simple JSON schema checker.
But the day after the jam ended, I wrote a self-contained webpage that they could have used.

The next weekend, I created a simplified [reactflow](https://example.com/FIXME)-based prototype
for uploading images, placing script-line nodes that use those character images,
and connecting them. It was very bare, but I liked the idea.

In early 2023 I played with compiling [chibi-scheme](/FIXME) to web assembly using [zig](/FIXME),
which helped me develop the eventual architecture and (tiny) build scripts I would need.

In mid 2023, I started working on a larger project, which I copy-pasted the prototype
reactflow editor into, and refined it. I also set up a backend service and web assembly compilation.
Then on September 19th, 2023, I started working on a much smaller project which had some feature,
cross-over, so I copy-pasted my refined prototype into a new repository and got to work...

### Step 2, don't sleep

September 19th, 2023 I posted in a private discord (I should really start microblogging).

the following weekend, following the outcry at Unity's new pricing, I decided I was going to take a break from my larger project to do this much smaller one.


### Step 3, sleep a little bit

### Step 4, oh snap I have two kids now

### Step 5, get lazy (burnout)

### Step 5, push through
